# Doppler Kubernetes Operator (Prerelease)

Automatically sync secrets from Doppler to Kubernetes and auto-reload deployments when secrets change.

## Overview

- The Doppler Kubernetes Operator is a controller run inside a deployment on your Kubernetes cluster
- It manages custom resources called `DopplerSecret`s, which contain a Doppler Service Token and the name of the Kubernetes secret where Doppler secrets should be synced
- The operator continuously monitors the Doppler API for changes to your Doppler config and updates the managed Kubernetes secret automatically
- If the secrets have changed, the operator can also reload deployments using the Kubernetes secret. See below for details on configuring auto-reload.

## Step 1: Deploy the Operator

Deploy the operator by running:

```bash
make deploy
```

This will use your locally-configured `kubectl` to:

- Create the resource definition for a `DopplerSecret`
- Setup a service account and RBAC role for the operator
- Create a deployment for the operator inside of the cluster

You can verify that the operator is running successfully in your cluster with the `rollout` command:

```bash
kubectl rollout status -w -n doppler-kubernetes-operator-system deployment/doppler-kubernetes-operator-controller-manager
```

## Step 2: Create a `DopplerSecret`

A `DopplerSecret` is a custom Kubernetes resource with a secret name and a Doppler Service Token.

When a `DopplerSecret` is created, the operator reconciles it by creating an associated Kubernetes secret and populates it with secrets fetched from the Doppler API in Key-Value format.

To follow along with this example, modify `config/samples/secrets_v1alpha1_dopplersecret.yaml` with your [Doppler Service Token](https://docs.doppler.com/docs/enclave-service-tokens).

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/samples/secrets_v1alpha1_dopplersecret.yaml
```

Check that the associated Kubernetes secret has been created:

```sh
# List all Kubernetes secrets created by the Doppler controller
kubectl describe secrets --selector=secrets.doppler.com/subtype=dopplerSecret
```

The controller continuously watches for secret updates from Doppler and when detected, automatically and instantly updates the associated secret.

Next, we'll cover how to configure a deployment to use the Kubernetes secret and enable auto-reloading for Deployments.

## Step 3: Configuring a Deployment

### Using the Secret in a Deployment

To use the secret created by the operator, we can use the synced Kubernetes secret in one of three ways. These methods are also covered in greater detail in the [Kubernetes Secrets documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

#### `envFrom`

The `envFrom` field will populate a container's environment variables using the secret's Key-Value pairs:

```yaml
envFrom:
  - secretRef:
      name: doppler-test-secret # Kubernetes secret name
```

#### `valueFrom`

The `valueFrom` field will inject a specific environment variable from the Kubernetes secret:

```yaml
env:
  - name: MY_APP_SECRET # The name of the environment variable exposed in the container
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: doppler-test-secret # Kubernetes secret name
        key: MY_APP_SECRET # The name of the key in the Kubernetes secret
```

#### `volume`

The `volume` field will create a volume that is populated with files containing the Kubernetes secret:

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: secret-volume
    secret:
      secretName: doppler-test-secret # Kubernetes secret name
```

Your deployment can use this volume by mounting it to the container's filesystem:

```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name: secret-volume
    mountPath: /etc/secrets
    readOnly: true
```

### Automatic Redeployments

In order for the operator to reload a deployment, three things must be true:

- The deployment is in the same namespace as the `DopplerSecret`
- The deployment has the `secrets.doppler.com/reload` annotation set to `true`
- The deployment is using the managed Kubernetes secret in one of the ways listed above

Here's an example of the reload annotation:

```yaml
annotations:
  secrets.doppler.com/reload: 'true'
```

The Doppler Kubernetes operator reloads deployments by updating an annotation with the name `secrets.doppler.com/secretsupdate.<KUBERNETES_SECRET_NAME>`. When this update is made, Kubernetes will automatically redeploy your pods according to the [deployment's configured strategy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#strategy).

### Full Examples

Complete examples of these different deployment configurations can be found below:

- [`deployment-envfrom.yaml`](config/samples/deployment-envfrom.yaml)
- [`deployment-valuefrom.yaml`](config/samples/deployment-valuefrom.yaml)
- [`deployment-volume.yaml`](config/samples/deployment-volume.yaml)

If you've named your Kubernetes secret `doppler-test-secret` in the previous step, you can apply any of these examples directly:

```sh
kubectl apply -f <(doppler secrets substitute config/samples/deployment-fromenv.yaml)
kubectl rollout status -w deployment/doppler-test-deployment-envfrom
```

Once the Deployment has completed, you can view the logs of the test container:

```sh
kubectl logs -lapp=doppler-test
```

## Failure Strategy and Troubleshooting

If the operator fails to fetch secrets from the Doppler API (e.g. a connection problem or invalid service token), no changes are made to the managed Kubernetes secret or your deployments. The operator will continue to attempt to reconnect to the Doppler API indefinitely.

The `DopplerSecret` uses `status.conditions` to report its current state and any errors that may have occurred:

```
$ kubectl describe dopplersecrets
Name:         dopplersecret-test
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

    Reason:                Error

    Type:                  secrets.doppler.com/DeploymentReloadReady
Events:                    <none>
```

- [`hack/get-secret.sh`](hack/get-secret.sh) can be used to fetch and decode a Kubernetes secret

## Development

This project uses the [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io).

When developing locally, you can run the operator using:

```bash
make install run
```

See the [Operator SDK Go Tutorial](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/tutorial/#run-the-operator) for more information.
